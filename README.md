### Setting Up StreamSense AI

StreamSense AI is currently available on multiple streaming platforms: Twitch, YouTube, and StreamYard. Instructions listed below for each

For the best results we'll use the popup chat method, although this will still work on other web browser views of your chat, even from the public audience view.

1. Open up your Twitch Stream Manager
2. Under your chat click the Settings cog icon next to the **Chat** button
3. In the options, click on **Popout Chat**
4. In the popup window that appears, you will see the StreamSense AI floating icon in the bottom-left of the screen

#### YouTube and StreamYard

1. Open up YouTube studio to start your live stream
2. Once you have started and have your chat visible, you will see the StreamSense AI floating icon in the bottom-left of the screen

### Using StreamSense AI

Once you have your live stream setup simply follow a few steps to get your analytics going!

1. Click on the floating icon to toggle the expanded view
2. Click **Start** to start monitoring your chat
3. After about a minute you will notice live analysis in the icon window if you have chat activity. The data will continue to update every minute while it's running.
4. When you are done with your stream, click **Stop** and you'll receive some overall insights about your stream!

### Understanding the Analysis

In order to maximize your time as a streamer and give you the quickest information possible, there are a couple of main points of analysis **during** your stream:

1. Viewer Mood - How the audience's sentiment is towards your content. Are they enjoying themselves? Are they bummed out? This will help you understand how engaging your content is and if you need to pivot in order to increase audience morale.
2. Keywords - Keywords or phrases you may have missed while streaming. These are designed to give you quick insight into what the chat is discussing without you needing to read each one, your time is valuable!

After you stream is done and you click **Stop** you will receive some additional anayltics on your overall stream:

1. Overall Viewer Mood - Same as above, except this is the average sentiment of the audience throughout your stream. Use this data as an opportunity to assess what went well or what could improve from your stream!
2. Future Content Suggestions - Sometimes during your stream there are some chat messages you'll miss completely! This data will help give you ideas for future streams as suggested by your audience.
